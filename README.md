This is a sample code targeted to using the TestContainers package for integration tests. 
In this project, I created a sample API to save data in an SQL server by EF core7 and used some third-party Apis, then I start to develop some tests for these APIs.
All tests are using separate contexts and run independently.

Hope it could be useful. ;)
