This is a sample code targeted to use the "TestContainers package" for integration tests.

In this project, I created a sample API to save data in an SQL server by EF core7, third-party API, etc. Then I started to develop some tests for these APIs.

TestContainers package helps you to run your project and its dependencies with docker technology and request them independently or with a shared context. I configure this project to run each test independently.

Please read the wiki page to undestand the code.

Hope it could be useful. ;)
